# **`WEEK 3 CODE CHALLENGE`**


## **`INTRODUCTION`**
The code is about Flatiron Movie Theater which is open for business! This application shows the user the movies available and enables them to buy the tickets

I used a local API and build out the frontend for our app, Flataculties. The files I used for the program are
* index.html
* style.css
* index.js

---

## **`DESCRIPTION`**
When the user is running the application, the title of the films are displayed on the left side of the screen. The Films on left side of the screen are the available films for the mean time, but once changes are made it will be updated accordingly. To display the information of the films, the user has to click on the title of the film.

Some of the information displayed are:
* The title of the film.
* The poster of the film.
* The description of the film.
* The runtime of the film.
* The showtime of the film.
* The capacity of the theater.
* The number of tickets sold.
* The number of tickets available.

## **`PROJECT SETUP`**
Since the work is already deployed on github there will be no need of forking the work, only the link will be needed to access the work. Once the link is available to the user then their work will just be to buy a ticket of the film they want.
